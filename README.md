# Simple-Calculator
I created a simple calculator using HTML and CSS, featuring a clean and minimal layout. The HTML structure includes buttons for digits, operators, and a display area for the result. CSS is used to style the calculator, giving it a neat, user-friendly design with a grid layout for the buttons.
